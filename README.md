Predicting Football Matches Results
This repository contains a Python-based project aimed at predicting the outcomes of football matches in the Bundesliga using supervised machine learning techniques. The outcomes are classified into three categories: 'home win', 'away win', and 'draw'.
Machine Learning Models
The following supervised machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest
•	Gradient Boosting
•	K-Nearest Neighbors
Each model was evaluated based on the following metrics:
•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall 
•	F1 Score
Model refinement played a pivotal role in improving the performance of all our models. The refinement process significantly enhanced the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, along with the overall accuracy of the models.
The most noteworthy improvements were seen in the Gradient Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbors models, both of which saw their accuracies increase from around 0.41-0.42 to 0.57. The Logistic Regression model's accuracy increased slightly from 0.43 to 0.44, while its macro-average F1-score also rose from 0.21 to 0.30. The RandomForest model, too, experienced improvements with the accuracy increasing from 0.46 to 0.52 and the macro-average F1-score improving from 0.40 to 0.47.
Results
Based on the evaluation metrics, the KNN model performed the best on the test data. However, results may vary slightly due to the variability and randomness in some of these algorithms.
